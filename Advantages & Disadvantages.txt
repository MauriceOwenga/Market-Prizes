After fitting the models and analyzing the livestock market price data, we can identify some potential advantages and disadvantages of selling at specific points in time:

Advantages
Early Selling during Droughts: From the exploratory analysis and model fitting, it may be observed that livestock prices tend to decline during drought seasons. Selling earlier, especially before the onset of droughts, can help mitigate the impact of price declines and minimize potential losses for the herders.

Strategic Planning: By understanding the seasonal patterns and trends in livestock prices, herders can strategically plan their selling decisions. They can capitalize on periods of high prices and avoid selling during times of low prices, thereby maximizing their profits.

Risk Management: Selling earlier allows herders to manage the risk associated with unpredictable factors such as climate extremes. By diversifying their selling times and not solely relying on specific seasons, herders can spread their risk and ensure a more stable income flow.


Disadvantages:
Timing Uncertainty: While selling earlier may help mitigate price declines during droughts, it also introduces the risk of selling too early and missing out on potential price increases. Herders need to carefully balance the timing of their sales to optimize their profits without selling prematurely.

Market Fluctuations: Livestock prices are influenced by various factors beyond just climate conditions, including market demand, supply dynamics, and economic factors. Predicting future price movements accurately can be challenging, and herders may face losses if prices unexpectedly decline after selling early.

Opportunity Cost: Selling early may result in missed opportunities to benefit from potential price increases in the future. If prices continue to rise after selling, herders may regret their decision to sell early and perceive it as a missed opportunity to earn higher profits.
